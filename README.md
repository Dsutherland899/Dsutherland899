## Hi there 👋

<!--
**Dsutherland899/Dsutherland899** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm David, an Account Manager based in London. 

I enjoy working on databases and conducting data analysis ever since I got a chance to study and use Data Analysis during my time at Imperial College Business School and previous work experience.

The main languages I use are SQL and Pyhton, while creating visualisations in PowerBI.

I am using GitHub to show projects I am working on and my overall learning journey.
